Landing Page Design Language (Refactor)

Black/White Minimal + Gradient Accents + Kaomoji System

1) What changes on a landing page

A landing page has one job: clarity + conversion.
So kaomoji can’t feel like “product UI noise”—it must act like micro-branding and state cues.

Rule of thumb:

1 kaomoji per block (Hero, each major section, CTA, FAQ).

0–1 kaomoji per card (not in every bullet).

Kaomoji = voice; gradients = attention.

2) Visual system (tightened)
Monochrome base (95%)

Pure minimal: flat surfaces, hairline borders, zero decoration.

Shadows are barely-there (only for hover separation).

Gradient accents (5%)

Use gradients only as thin emphasis:

CTA underline / glow

Active nav underline

Badge strip (left bar)

Selected card edge (1–2px)

Never: large gradient backgrounds, multi-gradient sections.

3) Kaomoji integration system (landing-page specific)
A) Where kaomoji should live

Kaomoji should appear in high-signal UI text, not decoration.

Landing element	Kaomoji role	Gradient role	Example
Logo/wordmark	brand signature	none	Notate (•‿•) (small)
Hero eyebrow/badge	tone setter	subtle badge strip	(•‿•) Keyboard-first capture
Primary CTA	gentle personality	gradient glow/underline	Join waitlist (•‿•)✓
Section headers	anchor + memory	none or tiny underline	(._.) Organize
Feature cards	state cue (max 1)	hover border	Auto-tagging (._.)…
Empty-state-style blocks (rare)	clarity + play	none	Nothing to scroll. (•_•)
FAQ answers	soften + human	none	Short answer: yes. (⌐■_■)
B) Kaomoji frequency limits (keeps minimal)

Hero: up to 2 kaomoji total (badge + CTA OR headline + badge)

Each section header: 1 kaomoji

Feature grid: max 30–40% of cards contain kaomoji

Footer: optional 1 kaomoji near copyright only

4) Kaomoji Dictionary (landing-page “small set”)

Landing pages don’t need the full product-state set. Keep it iconic + consistent.

Primary brand tone

Friendly / welcome: (•‿•)

Confident / “ship it”: (⌐■_■)

System cues (for feature descriptions)

Processing / auto: (._.)…

Question / clarify: (•_•)?

Done / success: (•‿•)✓

Empty / no clutter: (╯︵╰,) (use sparingly)

Hard rule: don’t invent new kaomoji on the landing page.

5) Section-by-section integration blueprint
NAV (sticky, minimal)

Logo: Notate + tiny kaomoji as a signature (optional)

Active section link: gradient underline (2px)

Don’t put kaomoji in every nav item. If any, only one:

Pricing (•_•)? is not recommended for nav; keep nav clean.

Best practice: logo only.

HERO (conversion zone)

Structure: eyebrow badge → headline → subhead → CTAs → social proof

Eyebrow badge with kaomoji:

(•‿•) Capture anything. Find everything.

Headline is pure, monochrome, no kaomoji.

Subhead can include one kaomoji if you want warmth:

Zero friction. Keyboard-first. (⌐■_■)

Primary CTA gets gradient halo/underline; optional kaomoji:

Join waitlist (•‿•)✓

Secondary CTA plain outline:

Watch demo

Keep hero visuals monochrome, gradients only on CTA focus/hover.

CAPTURE section

This is where kaomoji fits naturally because it’s “human input”.

Section title:

(•‿•) Capture (Zero friction)

Card copy patterns:

Hotkey capture: Instant capture (•‿•)✎

Smart link parsing: Auto-categorize links (._.)…

Long content collapse: Clean chips, no clutter (•_•)▾

Gradient use: only for the currently highlighted demo card edge.

HABITS section

Tone: “calm automation”, not chaotic magic.

Section title:

( •̀ ω •́ )✧ Habits (Automation)
If you want to stay ultra-minimal, replace with (⌐■_■) and keep it tight:

(⌐■_■) Habits

Card language:

“Suggested habit” badge: ( •̀ ω •́ )✧ Suggested

Running state in microcopy: Running… (._.)…

Gradient use: badge strip + 1 thin underline under “Habits”.

ORGANIZE section (Graph / Timeline / Types)

This section can feel “systems-y”; kaomoji helps keep it human.

Section title:

(._.) Organize (3 views)

Sublabels:

Graph ( •̀ ω •́ )⟷ (connections)

Timeline (•_•)⏱

Types (•_•)⌁

Gradient use: only for the active tab underline if you have tabs.

USE section (Output)

Make it feel professional. Use the “confident” kaomoji here.

Section title:

(⌐■_■) Use (Output)

Cards:

Ask your knowledge (•_•)?

WeChat assistant (⌐■_■)

Email composer (•_•)✎

Gradient use: primary card highlight only.

TEAM section

Kaomoji should be light-touch (don’t make founders look goofy).

Section title:

(•‿•) Built by builders

Founder cards: no kaomoji in the bio.
Optional tiny one in the footer line under the section:

Shipping weekly (⌐■_■)

FOOTER

One tiny signature is enough:

© VW.ai (•‿•)

6) Copy system (landing page templates)

Keep copy consistent with your kaomoji “voice”.

Benefit line: Do X without Y. (⌐■_■)

Auto feature: We handle it automatically. (._.)…

Ask/clarify: One question: ___ ? (•_•)?

Proof: Loved by fast builders. (•‿•)✓

7) Component styling rules (so it stays minimal)
Cards

Flat monochrome + hairline border

Hover: border darkens slightly + subtle shadow

Selected/featured: 1–2px gradient border OR top underline

Badges

Monochrome pill + tiny gradient strip on left

Badge text may include kaomoji only in hero/habits, not everywhere

Focus states (keyboard-first)

Focus ring is monochrome (accessibility)

Optional faint gradient halo only for primary CTA
